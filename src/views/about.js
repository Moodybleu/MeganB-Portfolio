            As a resident of the central coast for 25 years, I have been
            fortunate to discover various interests and hobbies that allow me to
            appreciate the stunning landscape. From photography and journaling
            to watercolor painting, I have found joy in creative outlets.
            However, it wasn&apos;t until I discovered software engineering that
            I found a passion that truly resonated with me. While the connection
            between software engineering and the natural beauty of the
            California coast may not be immediately obvious, for me, the
            elegance of code is akin to the splendor of my surroundings. With
            this in mind, I decided to pursue software engineering as a career,
            with the goal of using my skills to help preserve the beauty of my
            home for future generations.
